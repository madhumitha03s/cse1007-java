/**
 * On a certain day at an ATM of a bank there was an attempt of capturing
 * 3-digit PIN using a mirror set on the top of the wall by some intruder. All
 * the customers who used the ATM that particular day were asked to change their
 * PIN. The change of PIN requires three hours of time. The police wanted to
 * stop misuse of the PIN immediately and hence wanted to find PIN at high risk. 
 * The police assume that the PIN which is an exact mirror image of the
 * original PIN is at high risk. Help the police using a python program 
 * to get the PIN from user and display "RISKY" if PIN is
 * an exact mirror image and "NOT RISKY" if not an exact mirror image. Note: The
 * PIN will be the same as its mirror image if the digits are 0, 1 or 8 and the
 * PIN is a palindrome.
